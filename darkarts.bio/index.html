BCB 731.  Critical Readings in Biomedical Statistics and Machine Learning.  2 Credits.  

A survey of recurring statistical errors and pitfalls which are sometimes used to exaggerate the weight of evidence for novel biological claims or inflate the estimated accuracy of proposed predictive biomedical models. This course focuses on misapplied analyses of data sources where a small number of biological samples are quantified into very high dimensional feature spaces, such as in genomics, proteomics, and biomedical imaging.
Rules & Requirements  
Requisites: Prerequisites, Students should be familiar with both predictive modeling and inferential data analysis (BCB 720 or, eg, BIOS 661, COMP 755, or STOR 665) as well as general awareness of high throughput biological data; Permission of the instructor is required for students lacking the prerequisites.
